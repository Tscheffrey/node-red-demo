# Get Started with Node-Red

> This is a quick and easy demo for my blog post on the [Bitspeicher Blog](https://bitspeicher.blog/node-red)

- execute `docker-compose up`
- head over to [http://localhost:1880/](http://localhost:1880/) and try out Node-Red.

Node-Red will store your data in the `./node-red-data` folder inside the project. This is where you will find configuration files such as `settings.js`. To start again from scratch, just remove this folder and restart the docker container.

For more information visit the [official Node-Red documentation](https://nodered.org/docs/getting-started/docker).
